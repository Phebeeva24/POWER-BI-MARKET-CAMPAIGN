By analyzing these financial metrics, the organization can determine the profitability of its marketing initiatives and allocate resources more effectively to maximize ROI.

This allows stakeholders to quickly identify trends, spot opportunities, and address any issues that may arise in a timely manner.

By providing actionable insights derived from data analysis, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions that drive business growth, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

Overall, the implementation of the dashboard in an industrial context aims to enhance the organization's marketing effectiveness, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately achieve its business objectives in a competitive market environment.
